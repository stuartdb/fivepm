            It's 5:00pm and it's time for you to go home. You are represented
            by the small black square.

            To move around use the W A S D keys. The I J K L keys
            will also move you around and are probably a better alternative
            for lefties. To interact with objects, use the E or U keys, which
            ever you prefer.

            The goal of the game is to get to the exit, which is located a
            number of floors below the starting location in the lobby. The exit
            doors are the yellow squares.

            To go down a floor, use the stairs. Stairs going down are indicated
            by the purple square.

            Getting out of the office is only the main goal. The secondary goal
            is to increase your social standing in the work place. You start
            with no social standing and no social skills. As you walk around
            the office you will be able to sense the moods of your fellow work
            mates. Walk over one of your co-workers to sense their mood. They
            are represented by a blue square.
          </p>

            Once you are in the same cell as a co-worker use the interaction
            key (E or U) to interact with them. Their personality, mood and
            social status are taken into account to determine if you
            successfully socialised with them.

            Depending on the outcome, they will either be your friend or your
            enemy. Tough break, but first impressions count. If they turn out
            to be your friend, they will turn green. If they become your enemy,
            they will go red.

            You can keep tabs on your social status within the office and how
            your social skills are coming along. The UI bars at the bottom of
            the screen represents your progress. The black bar is for your
            social skills, this can only improve thankfully. The blue bar
            represents your social status, this will increase and decrease
            depending on the outcome of your interactions and the social status
            of the co-worker.

            When you have had enough of socialising, head to the exit in the
            lobby. You will be rewarded with a summary of your actions and the
            option to start again. Try to see how many friends or enemies you
            can make!
