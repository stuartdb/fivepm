            You're a software developer at a large nameless corporation.
            It's 5:00pm and it's time for you to go home. You are represented
            by the small black square.
          </p>

            To move around use the W A S D keys or the I J K L keys.
            To interact with objects, use the E or U key.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal of the game is to get to the exit, which is located a
            number of floors below the starting location in the lobby. The exit
            doors are yellow squares.
          </p>

          <p>
            To go down a floor, use the stairs. They are represented by purple
            squares.

            Getting out of the office is the main goal, the secondary goal
            is to increase your social standing in the work place. You start
            with no social standing and no social skills. As you walk around
            the office you will be able to sense the moods of your fellow work
            mates. Walk over one of your co-workers to sense their mood. They
            are represented by a blue square.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once you are in the same cell as a co-worker, use the interaction
            key (E or U) to interact with them. Their personality, mood and
            social status are taken into account to determine if you can
            successfully socialised with them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on the outcome, they will either be your friend or your
            enemy. Tough break, but first impressions count. If they turn out
            to be your friend, they will turn green. If they become your enemy,
            they will go red.
          </p>

            You can keep tabs on your social status and your social skills as
            you progress. The UI bars at the bottom of the screen represent
            them. The black bar is for your social skills, luckily, this can
            only improve. The blue bar represents your social status, this will
            increase and decrease depending on the outcome of your interactions
            and the social status of your co-workers.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you have had enough of socialising, head to the exit in the
            lobby on the bottom floor. You will be rewarded with a summary
            of your actions and the option to start another game.
            Try to see how many friends or enemies you can make!
